We previously looked at compound data and data abstraction.
To model stateful objects, we need mutators in addition to constructors and selectors.
A mutator is a procedure that modifies the data object.

3.3.1 Mutable List Structure⁠

The primitive mutators for pairs are set-car! and set-cdr!.
(set-car! p x) changes the car of the pair p, making it point to x instead.
The old car is unreachable garbage. We will see later how Lisp recycles this memory.
We could implement cons in terms of these two procedures in addition to a get-new-part procedure.

(define (cons x y)
(let ((new (get-new-pair)))
(set-car! new x)
(set-cdr! new y)
new))

Sharing and identity

Consider (define x (list 'a 'b)) and (define z1 (cons x x)).
z1 is a pair whose car and cdr both point to the same x.
In contrast: (define z2 (cons (list 'a 'b)) (list 'a 'b)).
In z2, the two (a b) lists are distinct, although the actual symbols are shared.
Before assignment, we would think z1 and z2 were “the same.”
The sharing is undetectable without mutators on list structure.
It is detectable in our environmental model.
If we set-car! on the car, this will change both a symbols in z1 but only the first in z2.
We can use the predicate eq? to test for sameness in the sense of identity.
(eq? x y) tests whether x and y point to the same object.
We can exploit sharing for good, but it can be dangerous.

Mutation is just assignment

Earlier we said we can represent pairs purely in terms of procedures:

(define (cons x y)
(lambda (sel)
(sel x y)))
(define (car p)
(p (lambda (x y) x)))
(define (cdr p)
(p (lambda (x y) y)))

The same is true of mutable data. We can implement mutators with procedures and assignment alone:

(define (cons x y)
(define (set-x! v) (set! x v))
(define (set-y! v) (set! y v))
(define (dispatch m)
(cond ((eq? m 'car) x)
	  ((eq? m 'cdr) y)
	  ((eq? m 'set-car!) set-x!)
	  ((eq? m 'set-cdr!) set-y!)
	  (else (error "Undefined operation: CONS" m))))
dispatch)

Assignment and mutation are equipotent: each can be implemented in terms of the other.

3.3.2 Representing Queues⁠

The mutators allow us to construct new data structures.
A queue is a sequence in which items are inserted at one end (the rear) and deleted from the other end (the front).
It is also called a FIFO buffer (first in, first out).
We define the following operations for data abstraction:
	a constructor (make-queue),
	a predicate (empty-queue? q),
	a selector (front-queue q),
	two mutators: (insert-queue! q x) and (delete-queue! q).
A simple list representation is inefficient because we have to scan to get to one end.
Scanning a list takes Θ(n) operations.
A simply modification lets us implement all the operations with Θ(1) time complexity: keep a pointer to the end as well.
A queue is a pair formed by cons ing the front-pointer and the rear-pointer of a normal list.

3.3.3 Representing Tables⁠

In a one-dimensional table, each value is indexed by one key.
We can implement it as a simple list of records.
A record is a pair consisting of a key and an associated value.
The first record in the table is a dummy, and it hold the arbitrarily chosen symbol '*table*.
	If a table was just a pointer to the first actual record, then when we wouldn’t be able to write a mutator to add a record to the front.
	We would need to change the table to point to the new front, but set! on a formal parameter doesn’t work as desired.
	It would only change the parameter in E1, not the value in the calling environment.
	We didn’t need to worry about this with sets because a set was a pair of two pointers a therefore we could mutate the car and cdr—but we couldn’t change the set itself, since it was effectively a pointer to the pair, copied on application.
	We are essentially using a pointer; we are using one cell of the pair. Some schemes provide box, unbox, and set-box! for this purpose.
The lookup procedure returns the value associated with a key in a table, or false if it cannot be found.
It uses assoc, which returns the whole record rather than just the associated value.

Two-dimensional tables

Two-dimensional tables are indexed by two keys.
In some cases, we could just use a one dimensional table whose keys are pairs of keys.
We can implement a two-dimensional table as a one-dimensional table whose values are themselves one-dimensional tables.
We could just use them like that without any specific procedures. However, insertion with two keys is complex enough to merit a convenient two-dimensional procedure.
We don’t need to box the subtables. They key of the record serves the purpose of '*table*.

Creating local tables

With our lookup and insert! procedures taking the table as an argument, we can manage multiple tables.
Another approach is to have separate procedures for each table.
We could use the message-passing style with the dispatch procedure that we’ve seen a few times already.
We could also take the λ-calculus approach:

(define (make-table) (lambda (k) false))
(define (lookup key table) (table key))
(define (insert! key value table)
(lambda (k)
(if (eq? k key)
	value
	(table k))))

3.3.4 A Simulator for Digital Circuits⁠

Digital circuits are made up of simple elements.
Networks of these simple elements can have very complex behavior.
We will design a system to simulator digital logic. This type of program is called an event-driven simulation.
Our computational model is based on the physical components.
	A wire carries a digital signal, which is either 0 or 1.
	A function box connects to input wires and output wires.
	The output signal is delayed by a time that depends on the type of function box.
	Our primitive function boxes are the inverter, and-gate, and or-gate. Each has its own delay.
	We construct complex functions by connecting primitives.
	Multiple outputs are not necessarily generated at the same time.
We construct wires with (make-wire).
Evaluating (define a (make-wire)) and (define b (make-wire)) followed by (inverter a b) connects a and b with an inverter.
The primitive functions are our primitive elements; wiring is the means of combination; specifying wiring patterns as procedures is the means of abstraction.

Primitive function boxes

The primitives boxes implement “forces” by which changes in the signal of one wire influence the signal of another.
We have the following operations on wires:
	(get-signal wire) returns the current value of the signal.
	(set-signal! wire value) changes the value of the signal.
	(add-action! wire procedure-of-no-arguments) asserts that the given procedure should be run whenever the signal on the wire changes value.
The procedure after-delay executes a procedure after a given time delay.

Representing wires

Our wires will be computational objects each having two local state variables: signal-value and action-procedures.
We use the message-passing style as before.
Wires have time-varying signals and can be incrementally attached to devices. They are a good example of when you need to use a mutable object in the computational model.
A wire is shared between the devices connected to it. If one changes it, the rest see the change.
This would be impossible if you didn’t model the wire as an identity, separate from its signal value.

Highlights

The truth of the matter is that, in a language in which we can deal with procedures as objects, there is no fundamental difference between “procedures” and “data,” and we can choose our syntactic sugar to allow us to program in whatever style we choose. (Footnote 3.27)

The agenda

The only thing left is after-delay.
An agenda is a data structure that schedules things to do.
For an agenda (define a (make-agenda)), the operations (empty-agenda? a), (first-agenda-item a), (remove-first-agenda-item! a), and (current-time a) are self-explanatory.
We schedule new items with (add-to-agenda time action a).
We call the global agenda the-agenda.
The simulation is driven by propagate, which executes each item on the agenda in sequence.

A sample simulation
Implementing the agenda

The agenda is a pair: the current time, and a list of time segments sorted in increasing order of time.
A time segment is a pair: a number (the time) and a queue of procedures that are scheduled to run during that time segment.
To add an action to the agenda, we scan its segments, examining their times. If we find the right time, we add the action to that segment’s queue. Otherwise, we create a new segment.
To remove the first agenda item, we delete the first item in the first queue, and if this makes the queue empty, we delete the first time segment as well.
Whenever we extract the first item with first-agenda-item, we also update the current time.

3.3.5 Propagation of Constraints⁠

We often organize computer programs in one direction: from input to output.
On the other hand, we often model systems in terms of relations among quantities.
The equation dAE=FL is not one-directional.
We will create a language to work in terms of the relations themselves, so that we don’t have to write five procedures.
The primitive elements are primitive constraints.
	(adder a b c) specifies a+b=c.
	(multiplier x y z) specifies xy=z.
	(constant 3.14 x) says that the value of x must be 3.14.
The means of combination are constructing constraint networks in which constraints are joined by connectors.
The means of abstraction are procedures.

Using the constraint system

We create connectors with (make-connector), just like wires.
We use (probe "name" connector), again just like wires.
(set-value! connector value 'user) assigns a value to the connector, and this information propagates through the network.
This will give an error if the new value causes a contradiction.
(forget-value! connector 'user) undoes the assignment.

Implementing the constraint system

The overall system is simpler than the digital circuit system because there are no propagation delays.
There are five basic operations on a connector c: (has-value? c), (get-value c), (set-value! c value informant), (forget-value! c retractor), and (connect c constraint).
The procedures inform-about-value and inform-about-no-value tells the constraint that a connector has (lost) a value.
Whenever an adder gets a new value, it checks if it has two and can calculate the third.

Representing connectors

A connector is a procedural object with local state variables—again, just like a wire.
Each time the connector’s value is set, it remembers the informant. This could be a constraint, or a symbol like 'user.
for-each-except is used to notify all other constraints.
