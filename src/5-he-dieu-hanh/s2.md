# Introduction to Processes

* * *

OSTEP: Chapter 4.

With so many things happening at once in system, need some
way of separating them all out cleanly. That is a process.

Important concept: decomposition. Given hard problem, chop
it up into several simpler problems that can be solved
separately.

What is a process?

- "An execution stream in the context of a particular process state."

- A more intuitive, but less precise, definition is just a running
  piece of code along with all the things that the code can affect or be
  affected by.

- Process state is everything that can affect, or be affected by, the
  process: includes code, particular data values, open files, etc.

- Execution stream is a sequence of instructions performed in a
  process state.

- Only one thing happens at a time within a process.


Is a process the same as a program?

Some systems allow only one process (mostly personal
computers). They
are called _uniprogramming_ systems (not uniprocessing;
that means only one processor). Easier to write some parts
of OS, but many other things are hard to do.

* * *

Most systems allow more than one process. They are called
_multiprogramming_ systems.

First, have to keep track of all the processes.
For each process, _process control block_ holds:

- Execution state (saved registers, etc.)

- Scheduling information

- Accounting and other miscellaneous information.


Process table: collection of all process control blocks for
all processes.

Miscellaneous

How can several processes share one CPU? OS must make sure
that processes do not interfere with each other. This means

- Making sure each gets a chance to run (fair scheduling).

- Making sure they do not modify each other's state (protection).


_Dispatcher_ (also called Short Term Scheduler): inner-most portion of the
OS that runs processes:

- Run process for a while

- Save state

- Load state of another process

- Run it ...
