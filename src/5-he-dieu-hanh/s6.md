# Semaphores and Producer/Consumer Problem

OSTEP: Chapter 31

The refrigerator example solution is much too complicated.
The problem is that the mutual exclusion mechanism was too
simple-minded: it used only atomic reads and writes. This
is sufficient, but unpleasant. It would be unbearable to extend
the fridge mechanism to many processes. Let's look for a more
powerful, higher-level mechanism.

Requirements for a mutual exclusion mechanism:

- Must allow only one process into a critical section at a time.

- If several requests at once, must allow one process to proceed.

- Processes must be able to go on vacation outside critical section.


Desirable properties for a mutual exclusion mechanism:

- Fair: if several processes waiting, let each in eventually.

- Efficient: do not use up substantial amounts of resources
  when waiting. E.g. no busy waiting.

- Simple: should be easy to use (e.g. just bracket
  the critical sections).


Desirable properties of processes using the mechanism:

- Always lock before manipulating shared data.

- Always unlock after manipulating shared data.

- Do not lock again if already locked.

- Do not unlock if not locked by you.

- Do not spend large amounts of time in critical section.
  E.g. do not go on vacation.

_Semaphore_:
A synchronization variable that takes on positive integer values.
Invented by Dijkstra.

- P(semaphore): an atomic operation that waits for
  semaphore to become positive, then decrements it by 1.
  Called `sem_wait` in pthreads (which we'll use on Linux).

- V(semaphore): an atomic operation that increments
  semaphore by 1.
  Called `sem_post` in pthreads.



  The names come from the Dutch, _proberen_ (test) and _verhogen_
  (increment).
  Semaphores are simple and elegant and allow the solution of
  many interesting problems. They do a lot more than just
  mutual exclusion.

Too much milk problem with semaphores:

**Processes A & B**

```

  01: P(OKToBuyMilk);
  02: if (NoMilk) BuyMilk();
  03: V(OKToBuyMilk);

```

Note: OKToBuyMilk must initially be set to 1. What happens if it is not?

Show why there can never be more than one process buying milk at once.

Binary semaphores are those that have only two values, 0 and 1.
They are implemented in the same way as regular semaphores except multiple V's
will not increase the semaphore to anything greater than one.

Semaphores are not provided by hardware (we will discuss implementation
later). But they have several attractive properties:

- Machine independent.

- Simple.

- Powerful. Embody both exclusion and waiting.

- Correctness is easy to determine.

- Work with many processes.

- Can have many different critical sections with
  different semaphores.

- Can acquire many resources simultaneously (multiple P's).

- Can permit multiple processes into the critical section
  at once, if that is desirable.


Semaphores can be used for things other than simple mutual
exclusion. For example, resource allocation: P = allocate
resource, V = return resource.
More on this later.

Semaphore Example: Producer & Consumer:
Consider the operation of an assembly line or pipeline.
Processes do not have to operate in perfect lock-step, but
a certain order must be maintained. For example, must put
wheels on before the hub caps. It is OK for wheel mounter to get
ahead, but hub-capper must wait if it gets ahead.
Another example: compiler & disk reader.

![Producer/Consumer](figures/s6-prodcons.jpg)

- Producer: creates new resources.

- Consumer: uses up (destroys) copies of a resource.

- Synchronization: Keeping producer and consumer operating reasonably and safely.

- Define constraints (definition of what is correct).

  - A Consumer must wait for the buffer to be non-empty, i.e., a Producer must have put
    something in the buffer.
    (resource management)

  - A Producer must wait for the buffer to be non-full, i.e., a Consumer must have removed
    something from the buffer.
    (resource management)

  - Only one process or thread can fiddle with buffer list at a time.
    (mutual exclusion)
- A separate semaphore is used for each constraint.


```
   const int QSIZE 100;
   Things *buffer[QSIZE];
   semaphore empty(QSIZE),
             full(0),
             mutex(1);
   int first=0, last=0;

   int ModIncr(int v)
   {
     return (v+1)%QSIZE;
   }

```

```
  void Enqueue(Thing *item)
  {
     P(empty);
     P(mutex);
     buffer[last] = item;
     last = ModIncr(last);
     V(mutex);
     V(full);
  }

```

```
  Thing *Dequeue()
  {
     P(full);
     P(mutex);
     Thing *ret = buff[first];
     first = ModIncr(first);
     V(mutex);
     V(empty);
  }

```

- Important questions:

  - Why does Enqueue do an `P(empty)` but `V(full)`?

  - Why is order of P's important?

  - Is order of V's important?

  - Do we we need two separate semaphores for waiting when the buffer is empty and full?

_Producers and consumers are much like Unix_
_pipes._

THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT EXAMPLE!
