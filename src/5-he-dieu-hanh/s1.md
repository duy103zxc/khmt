OSTEP: Chapter 2.

_Review class information sheet_

_This class is going to be different in some ways from your other CS classes._
_How you write code is going to be as important as getting it to work._

_This course puts together things from many other courses:_
_languages, architecture, hardware, data structures, algorithms._

* * *

_"Operating system" is a hard term to define._
_What you consider an operating system depends on your needs and your view_
_of the system._

_## WHAT IS AN OPERATING SYSTEM?_

_A scheduler/allocator:_

_- The operating system has resources for which it is in charge._
_Responsible for handing them out (and later recovering them)._

_- Resources include CPU, memory, I/O devices, and disk space._


_A virtual machine:_

_- Operating system provides a "new" machine._


_This machine could be the same as the underlying machine._
_Allows many users to believe they have an entire piece of hardware_
_to themselves._



_This could implement a different, perhaps more powerful, machine._
_Or just a different machine entirely._
_It may be useful to be able to completely simulate another machine_
_with your current hardware._
__Example of upgrading to a new piece of hardware.__
__This can get out of hand.__
__E.g., 1401 -> 360 -> 370 -> 3081.__


_A multiplexor:_

_- Allows sharing of resources, and provides protection from interference._

_- Provides for a level of cooperation between users._

_- Economic reasons: we have to take turns._


_* * *_

_According to these three views, if:_

_- we had enough hardware to give everyone too much;_

_- the hardware was well designed;_

_- the communications problem -- how to share knowledge -- is solved;_


_then we would not need operating systems._
_My view of operating systems says that they will still be needed:_

_As a servant and provider of services:_

_- Need to provide things like in the above views, but deal with environments_
_that are less than perfect._
_Help the users use the computer by:_


_providing commonly used subroutines;_



_providing access to hardware facilities;_



_providing higher-level "abstract" facilities;_



_providing an environment which is easy, pleasant, and_
_productive to use._


_This view as a provider of services fits well with our modern network_
_view of computing, where most resources are services._

_* * *_

_What are the desirable qualities of an operating system?_
_We can discuss them in terms of:_
_Usability, Facilities,_
_Cost, and Adaptability._

_- Usability:_
_- Robustness_


__accept all valid input without error, and gracefully handle all__
__invalid inputs__
_- Consistency_


__E.g., if "-" means options flags in one place, it means it__
__in another.__
__Key idea: **conventions**.__
__Concept: The Principle of Least Astonishment.__
_- Proportionality_


__Simple, cheap and frequent things are easy.__
__Also, expensive and disastrous things (rm \*) are hard.__
_- Forgiving_


__Errors can be recovered from.__
__Reasonable error messages.__
__Example from "rm"; UNIX vs. TOPS.__
_- Convenient_


__Not necessary to repeat things, or do awkward procedures to__
__accomplish things.__
__Example copying a file took a batch job.__
_- Powerful_


__Has high level facilities.__
_- Facilities_
_- Sufficient for intended use._

_- Complete._


__Dont leave out part of a facility.__
__E.g., protection with__
_- Appropriate._


__Do not use fixed-width field input from terminal.__
_- Costs_
_- Want low cost and efficient services._

_- Good algorithms._


__Make use of space/time tradeoffs, special hardware.__
_- Low overhead._


__Cost of doing nothing should be low.__
__E.g., idle time at a terminal.__
_- Low maintenance cost._


__System should not require constant attention.__
_- Adaptability_
_- Tailored to the environment._


__Support necessary activities.__
__Do not impose unnecessary restrictions.__
__What are the things people do most -- make them easy.__
_- Changeable over time._


__Adapt as needs and resources change.__
__E.g., expanding memory and new devices, or new user population.__
_- Extendible-Extensible_


__Adding new facilities and features - which look like the old ones.__

_* * *_

_Why study operating systems? Two perspectives:_

_- Outside - depends on your level of sophistication._


_A system to compile and run Java programs_



_Your average introductory Computer Sciences student._



_A system with many facilities - compilers, databases, file systems,_
_system calls._

_- Inside - internals, code, data structures._


_This is the system programmers view of an operating system._
_At this level you understand not only what is provided, but how it_
_is provided._

_## QUESTIONS TO ASK ABOUT OPERATINGS SYSTEMS_

__Or, why are studying this stuff?__

_Why are operating systems important?_

_- They consume more resources than any other program._

__They may only use up a small percentage of the CPU time, but consider__
__how many machines use the same program, all the time.__

_- They are the most complex programs._

__They perform more functions for more users than any other program.__

_- They are necessary for any use of the computer._

__When "the (operating) system" is down, the computer is down.__
__Reliability and recovery from errors becomes critical.__

_- They are used by many users._

__More hours of user time is spent dealing with the operating system.__
__Visible changes in the operating system cause many changes to the__
__users.__


_Why are operating systems difficult to create, use, and maintain?_

_- Size - too big for one person_

__Current systems have many millions lines of code.__
__Involve 10-100 person years to build.__

_- Lifetime - the systems remain around longer than the programmers who_
_wrote them._

__The code is written and rewritten.__
__Original intent is forgotten (UNIX was designed to be cute, little__
__system - now 2 volumes this thick).__
__Bug curve should be decreasing; but actually periodic - draw.__

_- Complexity - the system must do difficult things._

__Deal with ugly I/O devices, multiplexing-juggling act, handle errors__
__( **hard!**).__

_- Asynchronous - must do several things at once._

__Handles interrupts, and must change what it is doing thousands of times__
__a second - and still get work done.__

_- General purpose - must do many different things._

__Run Skype, Java, Fortran, Lisp, FIFA Soccer, Databases, Web Servers, etc.__
__Everybody wants their stuff to run well.__


_* * *_

_Operating systems are an unsolved problem._

_- Most do not work very well._

__Crash too often, too slow, awkward to use, etc.__

_- Usually they do not do everything they were designed to do._

_- Do not adapt to changes very well._

__New devices, processors, applications.__

_- There are no perfect models to emulate._


_* * *_

__(No, UNIX/Linux is not it. Nor are Windows or MacOS.__
__Maybe Plan 9?)__
__Unlike fields like electronics where there are such models (zero__
__distortion, flat response), any real system has (a large number of)__
__flaws.__
